* diff : this command lets you compare two different code side-by-side.we can add -u after diff command as an option to view the difference in a different format.diff is used to find differences between two files. On its own, it’s a bit hard to use; instead, use it with diff -u to find lines which differ in two files:


            diff -u python.py python1.py

* wdiff : wdiff highlights the words that have changed in a file instead of working line by line like diff does.diff -u is used to compare two files, line by line, and have the differing lines compared side-by-side in the same output. See below:

~$ cat menu1.txt 
Menu1:

Apples
Bananas
Oranges
Pears

~$ cat menu2.txt 
Menu:

Apples
Bananas
Grapes
Strawberries

~$ diff -u menu1.txt menu2.txt

* patch :  we typically use a command line like diff-u old_file new_ file > change.diff. As a reminder, the greater than sign redirects the output of the diff command to a file. So with this command, we're generating a file called change.diff with the contents of diff-u command. By using the -u flag, we include more context which helps the person reading the file understand what's going on with the change. The generated file is usually referred to as a diff file or sometimes a patch file. It includes all the changes between the old file and the new one, plus the additional context needed to understand the changes and to apply those changes back to the original file. 

            diff -u python.py python1.py >  change.diff

            Now, say you're the one receiving a diff file with a change and you want to apply it to a script you wrote. You could read the diff file you receive carefully and then manually go through the file that needs to be changed, and apply the modifications. But it sounds like a lot of manual work that could be automated, don't you think? Well, it sure is. There's a command called patch to do exactly this. Patch takes a file generated by diff and applies the changes to the original file.

            patch python.py < change.diff


            #ORIGINAL FILE

#! /usr/bin/env python3
import psutil

def check_cpu_usage(percent):
  usage =psutil.cpu_percent()
  return usage < percent

if not check_cpu usage(75):
  print( "ERROR! CPU is overloaded")
else:
  print("Everything is 0k")


            #DIFF FILE

def :

usage: {)" . format(usage))
return usage < percent


this difference in code can be added automatically by using patch command.

Eg:

~$ cat hello_world.txt 
Hello World
~$ cat hello_world_long.txt 
Hello World

It's a wonderful day!
~$ diff -u hello_world.txt hello_world_long.txt

* Git Revert Cheat Sheet:


git checkout is effectively used to switch branches.

git reset basically resets the repo, throwing away some changes. It’s somewhat difficult to understand, so reading the examples in the documentation may be a bit more useful.

There are some other useful articles online, which discuss more aggressive approaches to resetting the repo.

git commit --amend is used to make changes to commits after-the-fact, which can be useful for making notes about a given commit.

git revert makes a new commit which effectively rolls back a previous commit. It’s a bit like an undo command.

There are a few ways you can rollback commits in Git.

There are some interesting considerations about how git object data is stored, such as the usage of sha-1.
